# Heartfailure_nl
#This project presents an R-based data analysis exploring the association between heart disease and various **clinical**, **demographic**, and **lifestyle-related** factors. The goal is to demonstrate how reproducible research can be implemented using R Markdown while incorporating data management, visualization, and reporting.

## Project Overview
- **Title:** The Association Between Heart Disease and Clinical, Demographic, and Lifestyle Factors 
- **Author:** David Moshi  
- **Tools:** R, R Markdown, multiple data science libraries  
- **Output Formats:** PDF and HTML reports  

## How to Run
1. Open the R Markdown (`.Rmd`) file in RStudio
2. Run all chunks or knit the file to produce PDF or HTML output

NB: Incase your it fails, remember to update your R to containg the packages for the libraries used below

## Libraries Used
- Data wrangling: `dplyr`, `tidyverse`, `magrittr`
- Visualization: `ggplot2`, `corrplot`, `GGally`, `waffle`
- Modeling & reporting: `broom`, `car`, `vcd`, `knitr`, `mice`

Feel free to fork and adapt this for your public health or epidemiology projects!
